## diet rules motivation

I never again want to be scared of putting myself to bed. I want to be always rested. Fall asleep quickly and sleep well and strong.
I never again want to wake up in the middle of the night to eat.
I never again want to puke after overeating.
Remember all the nights when you've been putting yourself to bed for hours. Now you just lie in bed and sleep. This is the greatest gift.
To be able to work hard without constant hunger.
No decision making fatigue

## no smoking motivation

What with your head high
Causes impotence

## no caffeine motivation

I've discovered that I can feel well sleeping strongly regulary 6-7 hours a day between 10PM and 5AM. Getting up at 5AM is an amazing benefit for your day schedule.
